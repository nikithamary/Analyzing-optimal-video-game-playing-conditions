# Analyzing-optimal-video-game-playing-conditions

Goals:
1)We do an exporatory data analysis and test whether the Moore's law is valid by hypothesis testing
2)Given feature columns including Game Name, Game Settings, CPU type, etc. our aim is to predict the Frames per Second (FPS) obtained using a combination of the CPU, GPU, and game features as the predictors and the FPS achieved as the target.
3)To predict the different settings in which the game is played, namely (low, med, high, or max) using the specifications of the computer and game.
4)To divide the data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.

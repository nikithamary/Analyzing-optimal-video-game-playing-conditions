First-person shooter (FPS) games have seen a significant rise in popularity over the past decade. The proliferation of fast internet speeds, online gaming services, growth in the video game industry and technological advancements has made it easier for players to connect and compete with one another in real-time, boosting the popularity of FPS games. The rise of e-sports and competitive gaming has also played a role in the growth of FPS games. Many FPS games, such as Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Call of Duty, have professional leagues and tournaments with large prize pools, attracting top players and sponsorships from major brands. The popularity of these e-sport events has helped to draw more attention to FPS games and has contributed to the overall growth of the genre.
The advancement of technology and the increased accessibility of high-quality hardware and software has helped improve the achieved frames per second in different video games over the years. One of the key technological advancements that has contributed to the increase of FPS in games is the increase in processing power. Modern computers and gaming consoles are equipped with powerful CPUs that are capable of handling the complex calcu- lations required for high-quality graphics and realistic physics in FPS games. In addition to processing power, the improvement in graphics card technology has also played a role in the increase of FPS in games. Modern graphics cards are capable of rendering high-quality graphics at high frame rates, which is essential for smooth and responsive gameplay in FPS games. The increase in graphics card performance has enabled developers to create more detailed and realistic environments, as well as more complex character models and special effects, without compromising on the FPS. Combined, the technological advancements in CPU and GPU industry have made it possible for a gamer to play their desired games at higher frame rates than before.
Goals:
1)We do an exporatory data analysis and test whether the Moore's law is valid by hypothesis testing
2)Given feature columns including Game Name, Game Settings, CPU type, etc. our aim is to predict the Frames per Second (FPS) obtained using a combination of the CPU, GPU, and game features as the predictors and the FPS achieved as the target.
3)To predict the different settings in which the game is played, namely (low, med, high, or max) using the specifications of the computer and game.
4)To divide the data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.
